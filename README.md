# Contents
This repository contains the Matlab and Julia codes as well as additional instructions to replicate the results shown in Sections 2, 5 & 6 of the paper *On superlevel sets of conditional densities and multivariate quantile regression*.

# Usage

# Data
The data are a subset of households from the  U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2015. (The full survey interview files are public available via https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd_data.htm). The analysis in Section 6 is based on the variable labels: `houspq` (housing), `foodpq` (food), `utilpq` (utilities) and `fincbtxm` (income before taxes).
